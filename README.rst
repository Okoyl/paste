==============================
This is Paste (In Development)
==============================
Paste is forked from the original source pastebin.com used before it was bought.
The original source is available from the previous owner's `GitHub repository <https://github.com/lordelph/pastebin>`_
If you would like to contribute to developing Paste please feel free to find me on IRC. 

A demo of Paste is available on our homepage at `SourceForge <http://phpaste.sourceforge.net/demo>`_

Installer (In Development)
=========
* Create a database for PASTE.
* Upload all files to a webfolder
* Point your browser to http://yourpas.te/installation/install
* Input some settings, copy & paste the generated config into config.php, DELETE the install folder and you're ready to go.

Manual Install
==============
* Create a database for PASTE.
* Add the tables to the database (located in sql files, match the file to your DB software)
* Edit config.edit.php and rename to config.php

The configuration file is pretty well documented (config.php)
so you shouldn't have any problems with it.
